eCommerce website to selling psychology based coloring pages for children and adults. 

Named for my daughter whom I love. Psychology books have researched love, how to foster healthy relationships and how to achieve emotional wellness. I seek to teach her science based approaches to achieve balance in our lives through studying well researched psychological. I also do not know anything about psychology. I create coloring pages so we can explore the topics and internizes the lessons together while we bond over coloring. I also want to destimatize mental health by making the topic open for discussion in my family. It's okay to see a doctor to talk about mental health.
