eCommerce website to selling psychology based coloring pages for children and adults. 

Named for my daughter whom I love. Psychology books have researched love, how to foster healthy relationships and how to achieve emotional wellness. I seek to teach her science based approaches to achieve balance in our lives. I also do not know anything about psychology. I create coloring pages so we can explore the topics and internizes the lessons while we bond over coloring. 

This website is an ASP.NET application deployed through Azure and utilizes the nopCommerce platform to sell free and low cost PDF coloring pages to users.
