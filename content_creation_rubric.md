|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **5**      | Clearly defines purpose and offers maximum value; effectively saves time or reduces effort.     |
| **4**      | Well-structured content with clear purpose; mostly saves time or effort, though room for improvement. |
| **3**      | Provides some value, but purpose or time-saving aspect is less clear or not fully developed.     |
| **2**      | Purpose is vague or unclear; provides limited value and minimal time-saving insights.           |
| **1**      | Little to no clear purpose or value; does not save time or effort effectively.                  |
