### Vision for the Project (Updated with Content Definition):

This project aims to create a comprehensive **e-commerce and content platform** that allows **creatives** to manage and sell digital products, while also providing meaningful content designed to support women and mothers in their daily lives. The platform will celebrate inclusivity and diversity, featuring content **made by and for women and girls**. It will be hosted on **Azure** and designed to empower creatives with full control over their content, from blog posts to products, and be enhanced with minimal, aesthetically pleasing advertisements.

### Key Features:

1. **User Roles and Permissions**:
   - **Admin**: Manages platform-wide settings, content approval, and user roles.
   - **Creative**: Can create and manage blog posts and products, with the option to publish or save drafts.
   - **Regular User**: Browses published content and purchases products.

2. **E-commerce with PDF Products**:
   - Creatives can upload, sell, and manage digital products (e.g., PDFs).
   - Users can browse and purchase products that help them in their daily lives.

3. **Content Definition**:
   The content on the platform is designed to empower **women and mothers** by offering practical, actionable advice in the form of **workflows, life hacks, and how-to guides**. The content will be focused on helping women thrive by minimizing effort and maximizing return. The platform will feature:
   - **1-Page Explainers**: Quick tips and tricks that help women get the most out of their work and home life.
   - **How-To Guides**: Practical explanations on how to achieve tasks with ease and quality, such as how to cook a healthy, time-saving meal or manage a budget-friendly household.
   - **Cookbooks**: Digital cookbooks that are designed to help women save time and money while preparing nutritious meals for their families.
   - **Designs for Life**: Guides and suggestions on holiday menus, DIY gift ideas, and home projects. These guides will include links to resources (where to purchase supplies or how to make items) and show women how to do things **beautifully, quickly, and with quality**.
   - **Beneficiaries**: The content and products are aimed at helping **women and girls**, celebrating diversity and promoting inclusivity in everything from the recipes and tips to the design ideas. The platform will be a space for women to **share, learn, and thrive**.

4. **Drafts and Publishing System**:
   - Creatives can create content (blog posts and products), save them as drafts, or publish them when ready.
   - Blog posts and products will only be visible to users if marked as published.

5. **Advertisements (Aesthetically Pleasing and Minimal)**:
   - **Advertisements** will be placed in an aesthetically pleasing, minimal, and non-intrusive manner. Ads will be relevant to the platformâ€™s audience and placed strategically so as not to overwhelm the content, potentially linking to relevant tools, products, or services that align with the platform's mission.

6. **Data Sync with Azure**:
   - The platform will leverage **Azure SQL Database** to store and sync all content, ensuring that changes made by creatives are immediately reflected on the website.

7. **Scalability**:
   - The platform is designed for future growth, allowing the addition of new content categories, products, and even more complex workflows like content review or collaboration features between creatives.
